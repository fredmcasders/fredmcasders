Depending on the lender and the state you live in, the payday lender could charge a late fee or returned payment fee. Your bank or credit union may also charge a non-sufficient funds fee.

You may have a rollover option to extend the due date, but that usually comes with a fee.

If a lender is unable to collect the funds, your loan can be sent to a collections agency.

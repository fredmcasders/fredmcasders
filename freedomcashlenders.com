To qualify for a payday loan you typically need an active bank account, a government-issued ID and proof of income such as a pay stub. You must be at least 18 years old. Some lenders also require a Social Security number.

You still can be rejected for a payday loan, despite having income and a bank account. Lenders that charge APRs over 36% arenâ€™t legally allowed to lend to active-duty military, their spouses and their dependents, for example.
